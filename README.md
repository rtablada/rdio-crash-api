# RDIO Top Charts API

This API is to allow look up of top charts and other unauthenticated Rdio API information.

This API is used as the backend for The Iron Yard Little Rock crash course where we build the front page of Rdio using Ember.js.

To run this application create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file or set ENV variables for `RDIO_ID` & `RDIO_SECRET`
